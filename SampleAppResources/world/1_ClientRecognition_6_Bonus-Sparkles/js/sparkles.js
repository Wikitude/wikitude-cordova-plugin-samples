			Important: If you replace the tracker file with your own, make sure to change the target name accordingly.
			Use a specific target name to respond only to a certain target or use a wildcard to respond to any or a certain group of targets.

			Adding multiple targets to a target collection is straightforward. Simply follow our Target Management Tool documentation. Each target in the target collection is identified by its target name. By using this target name, it is possible to create an AR.Trackable2DObject for every target in the target collection.

			A sprite sheet is an image file that contains all key frame images required for the animation. The key frame image size (width and height) is passed at creation time and must be equal for all key frame images. Key frame images will be managed in an array, starting with entry 0. The key frame image array will be filled from left to right, row by row. Any partly filled key frames at the edge of the sprites sheet will be ignored.

			First the image resource is created which is used for creating the AR.AnimatedImageDrawable. Since the width/height of the sprite sheet is 512 and it carries 16 key frames, the width and height of a single image is 128. So we set 128 as the width and height of the AnimatedImageDrawable.

			Using an AR.HtmlDrawable it is possible to display HTML content inside the AR scene, the same way images are displayed. In this example a weather widget is added on top of the image target to present the real-time weather in Maui, Hawaii.

			In general any HTML content can be loaded by passing a relative or absolute URL. Additionally HTML content can also be passed as a string; please see the API reference for more details on how to specify the content when creating the drawable. This example uses a relative URL to the weather widget that is stored as .html file in the example's assets subfolder.

			Once the content has been chosen it is important to think about the viewport the content will need in order to be laid out correctly. The viewport is the area that is available to the HTML content when it is rendered. It is independent of the actual area the AR.HtmlDrawable will need on screen when placed in the AR scene.

			The viewport width and height needs to be set when constructing the AR.HtmlDrawable and should also be set as meta tag inside the HTML content that is used. This tells the HTML rendering engine to use the specified viewport size during layouting.

			Check out the viewport meta-tag in the weather.html:
			<meta name="viewport" content="target-densitydpi=device-dpi, width = 320, user-scalable = 0">

			Make sure that the value of width is set according to the size (in pixel) the HTML content needs. It should also correspond to the viewportWidth value specified during the creation of the AR.HtmlDrawable.

			Similar to viewportWidth the viewportHeight is specified to define the available pixel height during rendering of the content. If you are unsure of the pixel size of the HTML content at hand, you can use the developer tools built into modern browsers (e.g. WebInspector) to take measure.

			In the code example below we are putting that all together to a working AR.HtmlDrawable. The created drawable is added to the list of Trackable2D drawables just like any other drawable.

			Interaction with an AR.HtmlDrawable is controlled with the clickThroughEnabled and allowDocumentLocationChanges properties. Setting clickThroughEnabled will forward click events to the HTML content making it possible to follow links or click buttons. If the content of the HTML drawable should not change allowDocumentLocationChanges can be set to false so links are not followed. It is still possible to react on clicked links by using the onDocumentLocationChanged trigger. The example uses this trigger to open clicked links fullscreen in a browser.
